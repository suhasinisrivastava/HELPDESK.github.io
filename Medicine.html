                1.	Do not take any form of medication by yourself for any illness without a proper prescription
                from a doctor. Check with them once before taking any self-prescribed treatment.<br>
                2.	Follow a well balanced diet with little or no oil or spices involved.<br>
                3.	Drink 8â€“10 cups of water every day. You can also consume other drinks, fruits and vegetables that contain water, for example lemon juice (diluted in water and unsweetened), tea and coffee. But be careful not to consume too much caffeine, and avoid sweetened fruit juices, syrups.<br>
                4.	Continue the medications for other co-morbid illness after consulting the treating physician.<br>
                5.	Patients may perform warm water gargles or take steam inhalation twice a day.<br>
                6.  Patients must be in communication with a treating physician and promptly report in case of any worsening.<br>
                7.  For snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruit rather than foods that are high in sugar, fat or salt.<br>
                8.  Do not overcook vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins.<br>
                9.  Consume unsaturated fats (e.g. found in nuts, olive oil, soy, canola, and corn oils) rather than saturated fats (e.g. found in butter, ghee, etc.).<br>
                10. Daily, eat: 2 cups of fruit (4 servings), 2.5 cups of vegetables (5 servings), 180 g of grains, and 160 g of unsaturated fat based foods and beans
