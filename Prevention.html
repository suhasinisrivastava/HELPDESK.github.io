                <span>PREVENTION</span>
                1.	Clean your hands often and make sure to throroughly cover both hands. 
                Use soap and water, or an alcohol-
                based hand rub. Make sure that rub has 60%-95% alcohol.<br>
                2.	Maintain a safe distance of at least 1 meter from anyone who 
                is coughing or sneezing. Practice proper social distancing 
                every time you need to go outside.<br>
                3.	Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible. Ensure 
                that the mask properly covers the oral and nasal parts of your face and avoiding touching it often.<br>
                4.	If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical 
                attention. Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly 
                direct you to the right health facility.<br>
                5.	Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at any time while you are outside and cover your nose and mouth with 
                your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br>
                6.  Stay at home in case you feel unwell, and keep monitoring your conditions for as 
                long as you continue to feel in a similar way. Check with a doctor once as well.<br>
                7.  Sanitize any external item that is brought in to your house thoroughly, and do not bring 
                it in unless and until it has been properly cleaned for it to be safe.<br>
                8.  Make sure to keep your living environment clean and follow an immunity boosting lifestyle,
                with plenty of healthy foods and regularly exercise at home.<br>
                9.  After you return from a trip outside, make sure to carefully extract, properly sanitize and thoroughly
                wash any external apparel or accessories worn during this trip.<br>
                10. Do not take any form of medication by yourself for any illness without a proper prescription
                from a doctor. Check with them once before taking any self-prescribed treatment.
